1dr4no6,I want to be able to wear crop tops again. What do you suggest? ,"I had a baby one year ago. I have two under the age of 5, and don‚Äôt plan on having any more. I have some money saved up for cosmetic procedures and really want to focus my efforts on restoring my belly to where I can be comfortable wearing crop tops and bikinis again. 

I think my biggest concern is stretch marks and loose skin (it looks less loose after a large meal but then I just look bigger around the waist area).

1drkgj3,Why is every major fashion outlet going cropped.,"I'm looking for smarter shirts and blouses for office environments... However every store you could possibly look at in my town.. the only options that actually look nice tend to be too large or cropped which do not fit the office aesthetic.

I've looked in all sorts of places, tkmaxx, Primark, Hollister, super dry, new look, Matalan, etc. and I get so overwhelmed by style, material, price etc that I really struggle.

Does anyone have any recommendations for places to look or what to actually search.

1dr4faa,How do I fix greasy hair?,"( sorry if its bulky but I want to include every bit of information if it helps! :') )

My hair gets greasy overnight. I try not to wash it every day, but every second day it just feels super gross and oily. The youtube videos on ""training your hair"" haven't been helping me at all and I have no idea what to do. Because of this, I just gave up and wash it every day before school when I wake up in the morning.

I use a shampoo for oily hair, and I live in Australia. In Brisbane, the water is relatively hard - so maybe that makes my hair extra oily? I'm 15 (and female), and a lot of websites say that hormones, puberty, periods, etc., can make your hair oily. My hair isn't thick or thin, just kind of medium thickness. I'm mixed (white&chinese) so my hair is pretty straight.

I had a wayyy worse problem in 2020 before I changed to this shampoo that I've been using for 4 years.

[\(this is the shampoo I use\)](https://preview.redd.it/953q785wag9d1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4572c6bc5e3a8ce324c27cc30706b0f674d4ac6)

This routine of washing my hair in the morning wouldn't be a problem for me, but our school is hosting a German exchange. Basically the student that's staying over at our house is the student that's going to be hosting me.

In Germany, I can't be showering, washing, and blow-drying my hair every morning in someone else's home, let alone take up the bathroom for the whole morning when someone else is staying here. I'm just stressed about what I should do.

I've been washing my hair with cold water, making sure I'm cleaning my whole head + double shampooing (I've tried the silicone scrubber things), and making sure that I rinse absolutely everything out. I've also been changing my pillowcases too (silk ones aren't really an option for me), cleaning the combs that I use regularly (I don't use brushes), and staying away from conditioner. When I do use conditioner, I keep it at the ends too.

[\(my conditioner\)](https://preview.redd.it/11r6y4nuag9d1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9029b2c703b49ea577386448bf152f8de9cb187)

If I shower in the morning, my hair stays fine for the whole day - but overnight, it just turns into a greasy mess. Overnight hairstyles like braids don't work because my hair is shoulder length and I don't want the waves and curls from them in the morning. Since my hair is short, tying it up just leaves my hair bent in all different directions (and still greasy nonetheless).

I've been thinking to try a new shampoo, but if that doesn't work I have no idea what to do. Because of the exchange, I've just been worrying and want to figure it out now so I can start a good habit/routine that works for me (plus it would mean I don't need to shower every morning).

Does anyone have any idea of how I can fix this?

EDIT: I didn‚Äôt expect this much advice! Thank you so much for everyone that gave some suggestions!

Tomorrow i‚Äôm going out with my parents to buy some better quality shampoo, clarifying shampoo, and some dry shampoo to try the before bed suggestion. I read through every comment and quite a few people recommended Batiste, so i‚Äôll try to find some.

(About the clarifying shampoo, would the Ogx Apple Cider Vinegar be good? A lot of people also mentioned an ACV cleanse, and this is the only clarifying shampoo I can find at our local Coles)

As for a shower filter, my father said that he‚Äôll get one sometime later.

Also, I didn‚Äôt notice before, but I actually do touch my hair quite a bit - i‚Äôll start being conscious of that during the day too.

Thank you so much for the help again - I‚Äôm sure the comments will also help other oily haired people :,) ",nejisleftt0e

1drg9sk,Sad I look significantly older than my age,"There's been multiple instances throughout my life that people assumed I was older than I was, but generally only by a year or two. I guess I must have mature facial features; my face is more angular with not a ton of softness. This has always been an insecurity of mine and I always wished I looked younger than my age, with a cute, round face.

Well, today at work, my 32 year old coworker found out I was 28 and was utterly shocked and said ""Wow! I thought you were several years older than me!"". I don't think she meant it in a bad way because she quickly followed up with, ""Oh, but I mean it in a good way!"".

Unfortunately, as someone who is already very self-conscious about their appearance, it's hard to not be insulted that she thought I was at least 5-6 years older than I was, and seemed genuinely surprised I was so much younger. 

I guess I just don't understand why people think I'm older than I am, and why she thought I was SO much older than I am. I've been borderline neurotic about skin care and sunscreen since I was 20, and I honestly think I look my age, or at maximum no more than 2 years older. I dress fairly timelessly (imo), so I don't think my clothes look super outdated or anything, either. Maybe it's because I have had lifelong sleep disoders and don't sleep very well? Or maybe because I wear a ponytail at work, which I'll admit is not the most flattering style on me. I don't know, but it makes me sad.

The worst part is, I genuinely thought my skin looked good today when I woke up. Now I just kinda feel shitty.

Edit: My coworker is a very nice person and I'm not mad at her. I think she just made an offhand comment and didn't realize how it could potentially come across. It just happened to hit a direct insecurity of mine, which is why I was kind of hurt.",iceunelle

1dnx7aa,How have your thoughts or your approach to beauty changed since Covid? ,"Pre-Covid, I wouldn‚Äôt have been caught dead leaving my house without makeup on. I wore it to gym, grocery store, a walk, everywhere. I have rosacea and blush furiously and I was so self conscious about it that I would blush just for not having makeup on.


Pre-Covid, I almost always had straightened hair. Which is weird, because my hair is naturally thin and straight (just a slight frizz). Straightening it removed the frizz but thinned my hair considerably more. 


Once lockdowns started and we were wearing masks everywhere I barely wore makeup. What was the point? I also stopped doing anything to my hair. 
I was 27 when Covid hit and I noticed my eye hollows, dynamic wrinkles and crows feet got significantly worse that year. Caused by either being in my late 20s, or Covid stress, we‚Äôll never know. Having rosacea means I have consistently taken care of my skin since I was 12. But no amount of preparation or skincare now can help these aging eyes. 


The masks did not do my rosacea any favours and while I have a lot more education now about what works for me, my rosacea pattern has changed since Covid. 


But weirdly I just don‚Äôt care as much anymore. It‚Äôs crazy to think back about how much I stressed about my public image, like thinking I‚Äôd need to apologise if someone saw me without makeup on. Now my skin is somewhat worse with my rosacea, but I‚Äôll go to those normal places without makeup and idgaf who sees me. But was it just Covid?

1dnshim,Need advice on products for my African fiance',"I need a little advice. I'm a dorky white guy that doesn't know anything about beauty products or cosmetics. My fiance' finally got approved for her visa to come live with me after over a year of waiting. I plan on making a welcome basket with things like lady products, flowers, and cosmetics. I just had some questions about what products I should be looking for. I'm located in the midwest of the United States but I'm willing to order things if I need to.

The first thing I was wondering about would be hair products. She has curly, somewhat brittle/dry hair. I went to a local cosmetics store but I couldn't find many specialized products for black queens. The older woman that worked there couldn't really give me any advice.  

I was also looking for an acne treatment. She has local products for the acne on her face but I don't think they are available here. I was one of the lucky few that never really got acne so I don't even know where to start. It seems like there are a lot of products out there and I'm getting a little overwhelmed trying to figure out what works best. Every source I look at seems to suggest something different. 

The last thing I wanted to find a suggestion for is a soap or body wash for her lady bits. I've read that a normal Dove sensitive soap works just fine but I wanted to ask about this too.

maybe I feel this way because I'm quite a reserved kid at my school, people kinda dismiss me as irrelevant and overly studious and this was my chance to express my authentic self and look badass... and this is what I've got.

It's a weird situation, but I'm wondering if there's anything I could do to make myself feel better about it and more comfortable on the night? I don't even know if that's a legitimate question but any advice would be appreciated!

1dql37n,How I stay scent- neutral (EMT in a swamp) (Product recommendations),"Per title, I work 12 hour shifts in the swamps. You're sweating and in people's personal space- so you don't want to smell obnoxious. Purfumes and scents can be a trigger to a lot of people so the goal is to smell like as nothing as possible for 12, 14, sometimes 16+ hours. Here's what works for me, and some Product recommendations. I am not sponsored.



1) PM routine/shower- the Lume lineup of unscented shower gel, shower bar, and deodorant. I love Lume. They did have a weird aftersmell the first time I tried them out, but it's gotten so much better. Unscented lotion. TheraBreath is amazing, I feel fresh all day. 



2) AM routine- New to the line up is Anti Monkey Butt powder. This goes EVERYWHERE. I've had such an improvement after I added this into the routine with less chaffing and feeling damp.



3) Hygiene bag- All this gets thrown into a clear pouch that can be moved between my work backpack, purse and diaper bag. Tums (I'm 23 weeks pregnant, don't judge), a wet bag with extra underwear. Honey pot panty liners have a cooling feeling, I am constantly sweating down there and leak more than I want to admit (Again, pregnant). If there's anything on this slide, it's these right here. Lint roller, lotion deodorant (more hygienic to share when your partner isn't as prepared as you), tide pen, chap stick, mouth wash, hair elastics, gum, more unscented lotion. Body wipes. I got these as a free sample with my last Lume order, but I'll be honest. I don't love them enough to buy, and I'll probably go back to getting the hospital body wipes from the nurses once this pack runs out. Mini first aid kit with acetaminophen, antihistamine, gloves, antibacterial cream, and cute bandaids. While having a first aid kit on an ambulance seems like overkill, we can't use the meds on ourselves without paperwork and the bandaids I carry have kid friendly prints- and sticking a dinosour bandaid on a kids cast goes a long way with comforting them. 



4) I know I said no strong scents. But sometimes we deal with some pretty gnarly smells. There's peppermint oil we can spray on our masks, and a chapstick like tube that we roll under our noses to prepare. Chewing gum under the mask and we can deal with almost anything. I didn't know where else to put my hand sanitizer, this is clipped on my bag and gets used almost constantly. 



5) The Holy Grail. Water. Staying hydrated helps with smell, and also I don't want to end up on the stretcher myself. I'll have an electrolyte packet on a good day, 2 on a rough day. 



Honorary mentions are compression socks and good fitting shoes. They go a long way in helping you feel better/look better/do the job better. And while niche, I've been using KT tape on my belly to relieve some pressure. My uniform fits better and I've had people tell me I'm not making faces of discomfort nearly as often.



If you take anything away from this, it's STAY HYDRATED

1dpjbkm,How I whiten my teeth at home ,"I‚Äôve seen this topic come up a lot on this sub, and I‚Äôve gotten compliments for my white teeth so I thought I would share my inexpensive method for teeth whitening. 

Materials: I only use a mouth guard and tooth whitening pens, which I got on Amazon, but can be found anywhere. 
The mouth guard I got is the kind for teeth grinding at night, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, you just need something that can be shaped to your teeth. I use the cheapest tooth whitening pens I can find on Amazon, as long as they have some form of peroxide, it‚Äôs good enough. 

Process: 2-3 times a week, I start my night routine earlier than usual. I brush and floss thoroughly. I use a towel corner to wipe my teeth dry of saliva. Then, keeping my mouth open to avoid saliva getting on my teeth, I place some of the gel on my front 12 teeth (6 on the top, 6 on the bottom because those are the only visible ones). I then quickly place my mouth guard and leave it in for 30 minutes or so. When I take them out, I spit out the saliva but I don‚Äôt rinse. Et voil√†, my teeth are white and I get compliments pretty frequently. I am fortunate not to have sensitive teeth, so the results may differ for other people.

1doc6v1,Strawberry legs & fast growing hair,"I‚Äôm so frustrated! My hair grows back insanely fast‚Äî particularly on my legs. I shaved my legs Sunday evening and this is how they look now on Tuesday afternoon. I have been self tanning so it‚Äôs ~slightly~ less noticeable rn but I am naturally pale and my hair is DARK. 

I have tried 
-Exfoliating with sugar scrub before shaving
-Exfoliating with a silicone pad before shaving
-Shaving lotion, cream, butter and oil‚Äî even hair conditioner 
-Only shaving with a brand new razor 
-Salicylic acid body wash
-Peach & Lily KP bump boss
-Body oil/butter/ or lotion  post shave
-Nair 

I have NOT tried
-waxing or sugar waxing (it‚Äôs too hot and I‚Äôm too impatient to wait for my hair to be long enough to make an appointment) I did try waxing once at home with something I got from the store and it made my skin ANGRY and it hurt too much. My legs were even redder in the spot (probably a mixture of bad quality product and user error tbh lol) 
-laser hair removal ($$$$) 
-an epilator (too many mixed reviews)

So I thought to treat myself I would get my first mani pedi.

But since I am brand new to this sort of thing I really have no idea how long your nails are supposed to be? Like basically all my nails atm need a proper routine trimming/filing but they are just over normal cut length. Is there a general standard to follow? Or how does this work?

I am a man if it's not obvious and all I'd want it maybe a clear coat. Idk maybe it sounds lame to you but it was extremely difficult at the start so I am tryiing to healthily reward myself and hopefully reinvigorate my desire to stop my OCD picking.
